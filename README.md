# Hear-Risk-Predictor-ML-MODEL
The proposed work is the construction of an ML model (could be a Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes etc.) which will read from existing heart disease-related datasets, and analyse all the independent variables.  After the testing-training data split, we predict the dependent variable of the testing data.  Later, we will compare the accuracy between the test set and the predicted values of the dependent variable.

Having a plethora of data, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels, and even other behavioural data such as smoking history, and other prevalent health issues, this seemingly random data is streamlined into information that is fed into machine learning algorithms, to predict whether or not a person is risk-free.

With proper visualization and various other accuracy metrics, we can correlate which variables are essential markers of predicting heart risk. 
 
## WORKING
The working of the system starts with the collection of data and selecting the important attributes. Then the required data is preprocessed into the required format. The data is then divided into two parts training and testing data.The algorithms are applied and the model is trained using the training data. The accuracy of the system is obtained by testing the system using the testing data. 
This system is implemented using the following modules-
1. Collection of Dataset 
2. Selection of attributes 
3.Data Pre-Processing 
4. Balancing of Data 
5. Disease Prediction

## CONCLUSION
We have gone through many steps in the advancements of medicine. In the near future, technology will be fast approaching and streamlining processes that usually took days, sometimes weeks to complete. The advantages of machine learning and artificial intelligence in diagnosis have been pointed out very heavily, and the most important part of the prediction taking very less time compared to an actual diagnosis, is reason enough to consider the use of Machine Learning for Cardiac Diagnosis. The most immediate advantage of a faster diagnosis is the early detection of heart risk in patients with multiple heart risk factors. There are many other advantages in the study of demographics and the deeper research of cardiology for which many such machine learning tools need to be implemented.
